<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>
  Welcome to my blog! My name is Adam Schønemann. I am a programmer who likes
  safe, functional statically-typed programming languages, which is also mainly
  what I blog about.
</p>

<p>
  I'm currently looking for functional programming in jobs in Copenhagen or remote,
  so feel free to contact me using any of the links on my
  <a href="/about.html">
    about page
  </a>.
